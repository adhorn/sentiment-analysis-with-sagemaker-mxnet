# Sentiment Analysis with MXNet on Amazon SageMaker

This repo contains python scripts and Jupyter notebook to demonstrate building, training and hosting a movie review sentiment analysis model with Apache MXNet and Amazon SageMaker.

To run it, go to [SageMaker](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=us-east-1#/endpoints), start a new notebook, and upload the files.

Enjoy!

The model is based on:
- The paper ["Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759) by Joulin et al.
- The example notebook from SageMaker Python SDK ["MXNet Gluon Sentiment"](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/mxnet_gluon_sentiment)
